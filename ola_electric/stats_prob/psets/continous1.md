1.	If X is a normally distributed random variable with mean 120 and standard deviation 44, find a value x such that the probability that X will be less than x is 0.56.
2.	Letâ€™s say we are interested in IQ of Jigsaw students. We test  100 students and find that  IQ is normally distributed with an average of 108, and a std deviation of 7.  Supposing you pick a random student. What are the chances that the student has an IQ  > 115? 
3.	Let X be a normally distributed random variable with mean 410 and standard deviation 2. Find the probability that X will be between 407 and 415.
4.	If X is normally distributed with mean 500 and standard deviation 20, find the probability that X will be above 555.
5.	Let X be a normally distributed random variable with mean of 16 and standard deviation of 3. Find P(11 < X <20). Also find P(17 < X < 19) and P(X < 15)
6.	The number of votes cast in favor of a controversial proposition is believed to be approximately normally distributed with mean 8,000 and standard deviation 1,000. The proposition needs at least 9,322 votes in order to pass. What is the probability that the proposition will pass? (Assume numbers are on a continuous scale.)
