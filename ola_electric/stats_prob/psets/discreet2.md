1. Baggage is rarely lost by Northwest Airlines. Most flights do not experience any mishandled bags; some have one bag lost; a few have two bags lost; rarely a flight will have three lost bags; and so on. Suppose a random sample of 1,000 flights shows a total of 300 bags were lost. Thus, the arithmetic mean number of lost bags per flight is 0.3. Find out the probability of 

- No bag lost
- Losing one bag

2. Textbook authors and publishers work very hard to minimize the number of errors in a text. However, some errors are unavoidable. Mr. J. A. Carmen, statistics editor, reports that the mean number of errors per chapter is O.B. What is the probability that there are less than 2 errors in a particular chapter?

3. Phone calls arrive at the rate of 48 per hour at the reservation desk for Regional Airways.
- Compute the probability of receiving three calls in a 5-minute interval of time.
- Compute the probability of receiving exactly 10 calls in 15 minutes.
- Suppose no calls are currently on hold. If the agent takes 5 minutes to complete the
current call, how many callers do you expect to be waiting by that time? What is the
probability that none will be waiting?
- If no calls are currently being processed, what is the probability that the agent can take 3 minutes for personal time without being interrupted by a call?

4. Airline passengers arrive randomly and independently at the passenger-screening facility at a major international airport. The mean arrival rate is 10 passengers per minute.
- Compute the probability of no arrivals in a one-minute period.
- Compute the probability that three or fewer passengers arrive in a one-minute period.
- Compute the probability of no arrivals in a 15-second period.
- Compute the probability of at least one arrival in a 15-second period.
