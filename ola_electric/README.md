## Topics and Learning Objectives (Session wise)

### Statistics and Probability Theory

**Topics**
Descriptive Statistics: Measures of central tendency, measures of variance

**LO**
1. GIven a dataset use appropriate measure of central tendency
2. Comment on the nature of variation and skew that is expected to e seen in common data collection scenarios

**Topics**
Inferential Statistics: Probability Distributions, Sampling, Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution, Normal Distribution

**LO**
1. Given a business context be able to identify the appropriate distribution to use
2. Compute cumulative and point probabilities and answer business questions

**Topics**
Hypothesis Testing: Large and small sample tests using t distribution, two sample t test, 1 way ANOVA and Chi Square test for factor independence

**LO**
1. Given a business problem, write appropriate null and alternate hypothesis
2. Compute p-value and arrive at a correct interpretation of it in the context of business problem
3. Assess the subjective impact of committing type 1 and type 2 errors

### Predictive Modelling

**Topics**
Data Exploration and Generation of Business Hypothesis

**LO**
1. Identify what business questions can and can't be answered with the data at hand
2. Identify any potential issues on data quality side
3. Propose what target variable should be modelled and how

**Topics**
Linear Regression: Understand beta estimation via OLS and Maximum Likelihood estimation. Check assumptions of CLRM, Stepwise regression

**LO**
1. Interpret beta coefficients for both categorical and continuos variables
2. Identify violations of CLRM and suggest remedial steps
3. Interpret p-values for each predictor
4. Do relevant transformations of target and predictor variables

**Topics**
Logistic Regression: Understand the idea of logits. Logistic cost function, confusion matrix, auc. Beta interpretation

**LO**
1. Interpret beta coefficients for both categorical and continuos variables
2. Finalize a model by analyzing confusion matrix. and AUC
3. Interpret beta estimates as affecting log odds of event
4. Create and interpret gains and lift tables
